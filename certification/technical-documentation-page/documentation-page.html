            Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
            efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
            approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and
            dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an
            ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in
            many areas on most platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely
            available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the
            Python web site, and may be freely distributed. The same site also
            contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party
            Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.

            Python is a very popular general-purpose interpreted, interactive,
            object-oriented, and high-level programming language. Python is
            dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language. It was
            created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python
            source code is also available under the GNU General Public License
            (GPL).

            Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task
            automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it's
            relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many
            non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of
            everyday tasks, like organizing finances.

            “Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,” says
            University of Michigan and Coursera instructor Charles R Severance
            in his book Python for Everybody. “You can write programs for many
            reasons, ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data
            analysis problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a
            problem.”

            Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward
            syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate
            (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print"
            directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a
            newline, unlike in C).
          </p>

          <p>
            There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2
            and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it
            more semantically correct and supports newer features.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print
            statement. In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and
            therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3,
            it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.
          </p>

          <p>To print a string in Python 3, just write:</p>

          <code
            ># This is my first Python program. # This will print 'Hello,
            World!' as the output print ("Hello, World!");</code
          >

            Python programming provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for
            class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are
            denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.
          </p>

          <p>
            The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all
            statements within the block must be indented the same amount. For
            example:
          </p>

          <code>if True: print ("True") else: print ("False") </code>
          <p>However, the following block generates an error:</p>

          <code
            >if True: print ("Answer") print ("True") else: print ("Answer")
            print ("False")
          </code>
          <p>
            Thus, in Python all the continuous lines indented with same number
            of spaces would form a block. The following example has various
            statement blocks
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <q
              >Do not try to understand the logic at this point of time. Just
              make sure you understood various blocks even if they are without
              braces.</q

        <article>
          <p>
            Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory
            space or you can say to create a variable. A Python variable is
            created automatically when you assign a value to it. The equal sign
            (=) is used to assign values to variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the
            variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value
            stored in the variable. For example:
          </p>

          <code
            >counter = 100 # Creates an integer variable miles = 1000.0 #
            Creates a floating point variable name = "Zara Ali" # Creates a
            string variable</code
          >

          <header>Printing Python Variables</header>
          <p>
            Once we create a Python variable and assign a value to it, we can
            print it using print() function. Following is the extension of
            previous example and shows how to print different variables in
            Python:
          </p>
          <code
            >counter = 100 # Creates an integer variable miles = 1000.0 #
            Creates a floating point variable name = "Zara Ali" # Creates a
            string variable print (counter) print (miles) print (name)</code
          >
          <p>
            Here, 100, 1000.0 and "Zara Ali" are the values assigned to counter,
            miles, and name variables, respectively. When running the above
            Python program, this produces the following result
          </p>
          <code>100 1000.0 Zara Ali </code>

          <p>
            Python Data Types are used to define the type of a variable. It
            defines what type of data we are going to store in a variable. The
            data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's
            age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as
            alphanumeric characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python has various built-in data types which we will discuss with in
            this tutorial:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Numeric - int, float, complex</li>
            <li>String - str</li>
            <li>Sequence - list, tuple, range</li>
            <li>Binary - bytes, bytearray, memoryview</li>
            <li>Mapping - dict</li>
            <li>Boolean - bool</li>
            <li>Set - set, frozenset</li>
            <li>None - NoneType</li>
          </ul>

            A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to
            perform a single, related action. Functions provide better
            modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like
            print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These
            functions are called <i>user-defined functions.</i>
          </p>

            >def functionname( parameters ): "function_docstring" function_suite
